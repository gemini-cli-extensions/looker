# Looker Extension

This document provides instructions for the Gemini agent to assist users with the Looker extension.

## Setup

This section covers connecting to a Looker instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: Before attempting to connect, confirm with the user that the following environment variables are set in the extension configuration or their shell environment.

    *   `LOOKER_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your Looker instance.
    *   `LOOKER_CLIENT_ID`: The Looker API client ID.
    *   `LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Looker API client secret.
    *   `LOOKER_VERIFY_SSL`: (Optional) Whether to verify SSL certificates. Defaults to `true`.
    *   `LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_MODELS`: (Optional) Whether to show models that are hidden in the UI. Defaults to `true`.
    *   `LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_EXPLORES`: (Optional) Whether to show explores that are hidden in the UI. Defaults to `true`.
    *   `LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_FIELDS`: (Optional) Whether to show fields that are hidden in the UI. Defaults to `true`.

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${LOOKER_BASE_URL}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3.  **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the correct permissions in Looker to perform the requested actions.

## Information for Querying Data

1.  **Models**: Looker will have one or more data models defined. You will need
    to use the `get_models` tool to find the proper model. You can also display
    the list of models to the user and ask them for the proper model to use.
2.  **Explores**: A Looker model will contain one or more explores. Exploresr
    describe a set of prejoined database tables to answer questions about a
    particular topic area.
3.  **Dimensions**: A Looker explore will have a list of dimensions that are
    used for filtering and also used for labeling data in an explore. Dates,
    categories, addresses, etc. are dimensions. Any field that would naturally
    be in the GROUP BY clause of a SQL statement is a dimension.
4.  **Measures**: A Looker explore will also have a list of measures. These are
    fields that use SQL Aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, or AVG.
5.  **Filters**: A Looker explore may have filters. These are fields that are
    **only** used for filtering.
6.  **Parameters**: A Looker explore may have parameters. These are fields that
    are passed in through filtering, but are used for thresholds and
    categorization. For example, the `large_order_threshold` might be set to 100
    in some queries but 50 in others.

## Information for Creating Content

The description of the `query_url` tool has details on how to specify Looker
visualizations. Use this for creating looks and dashboards as well.

A good dashboard usually has between 6 and 12 elements.
