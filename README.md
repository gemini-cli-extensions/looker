# Gemini CLI Extension - Looker

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This Gemini CLI extension provides a set of tools to interact with [Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs) instances. It allows you to manage your Looks, dashboards, and explores directly from the [Gemini CLI](https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/), using natural language prompts.

## Why Use the Looker Extension?

* **Seamless Workflow:** Stay in your CLI. No need to constantly switch contexts.
* **Connect to Looker:** Securely connect to your Looker instances.
* **Natural Language Usage:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. List models, explores, and dimensions, and run Looks and queries by describing what you want in plain English.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed with version **+v0.6.0**.
* Setup Gemini CLI [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-authentication-options).
* A Looker instance with API access enabled.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the extension, use the command:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/looker
```

### Configuration

You will need a Looker Client Id and Client Secret. These can be obtained by
following the directions at [Looker API authentication](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/api-auth#authentication_with_an_sdk). If you
don't have access to the Admin pages of the Looker system, you will need to ask
your administrator to get the Id and Secret for you.

Set the following environment variables before starting the Gemini CLI. These variables can be loaded from a `.env` file.

```bash
export LOOKER_BASE_URL="<your-looker-instance-url>"  # e.g. `https://looker.example.com`. You may need to add the port, i.e. `:19999`.
export LOOKER_CLIENT_ID="<your-looker-client-id>"
export LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-looker-client-secret>"
export LOOKER_VERIFY_SSL="true" # Optional, defaults to true
export LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_MODELS="true" # Optional, defaults to true
export LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_EXPLORES="true" # Optional, defaults to true
export LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_FIELDS="true" # Optional, defaults to true
```

### Start Gemini CLI

To start the Gemini CLI, use the following command:

```bash
gemini
```

## Usage
You can ask questions and give commands such as these:

1. What models are available in my Looker instance?
2. What explores are available in *model_name*?
3. What measures and dimensions are in *explore_name*?
4. Using *model_name*, what is the total revenue in 2025? Break that
   down by month and pivot by product category.
5. What is the sql for that last query?
6. Visualize that data using a stacked column chart and give me the url to it.
7. Save that as a Look.
8. Run the Look titled "Revenue Projection".
9. Create a dashboard analyzing sales for the year 2025.
