## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed.
*   A Looker instance with API access enabled.

## Installation

To install the extension, use the `gemini extensions install` command:

```bash
gemini extensions install github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/looker.git
```

## Configuration

You will need a Looker Client Id and Client Secret. These can be obtained by
following the directions at
https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/api-auth#authentication_with_an_sdk. If you
don't have access to the Admin pages of the Looker system, you will need to ask
your administrator to get the Id and Secret for you.

*   `LOOKER_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your Looker instance like
    `https://looker.example.com`. In some cases you may need to add `:19999` to
    the URL as well.
*   `LOOKER_CLIENT_ID`: The Looker API client ID.
*   `LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Looker API client secret.
*   `LOOKER_VERIFY_SSL`: (Optional) Whether to verify SSL certificates. Defaults to `true`.
*   `LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_MODELS`: (Optional) Whether to show models that are
    hidden in the UI. Defaults to `true`.
*   `LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_EXPLORES`: (Optional) Whether to show explores that are
    hidden in the UI. Defaults to `true`.
*   `LOOKER_SHOW_HIDDEN_FIELDS`: (Optional) Whether to show fields that are
    hidden in the UI. Defaults to `true`.


## Usage
You can ask questions and give commands such as these:

1. What models are available in my Looker instance?
2. What explores are available in *model_name*?
3. What measures and dimensions are in *explore_name*?
4. Using *model_name*, what is the total revenue in 2025? Break that
   down by month and pivot by product category.
5. What is the sql for that last query?
6. Visualize that data using a stacked column chart and give me the url to it.
7. Save that as a Look.
8. Run the Look titled "Revenue Projection".
9. Create a dashboard analyzing sales for the year 2025.

## Security

This extension executes commands against your Looker instance. Always review the generated queries before execution.
